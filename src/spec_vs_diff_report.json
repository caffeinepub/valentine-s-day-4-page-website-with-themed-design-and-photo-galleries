  "summary": "Implemented a 4-route Valentine-themed frontend with shared layout, navigation, and page components referencing specified uploaded/generated images. However, required static image assets are not shown as added, Page 3 text does not exactly match the requested copy (missing leading/trailing spaces), and the diff introduces/changes Internet Identity/actor hook files and other unrequested UI elements (e.g., footer attribution, lightbox).",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Page 3 must display the text exactly: \" I will always have all the gift that u gave Mee in my heart \".",
