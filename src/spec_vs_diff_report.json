  "summary": "A new final page component and route were added (/beginning), and both the top navigation and sequential pager were updated to include it as the last step. However, the diff does not show the newly uploaded PNG files being added under frontend/public/assets/uploads, and the final page gallery only references 4 images rather than all required uploaded PNGs. An extra user-facing subtitle line was also added that was not requested.",

      "requirement": "Add the newly uploaded images as frontend static assets under frontend/public/assets/uploads so they can be referenced by filename via /assets/uploads/<filename> (including all listed PNGs; deduplicate repeated 1771025145088-1.png without breaking references); no backend image serving.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any new files added under frontend/public/assets/uploads (only a TSX page was added and several TS/TSX files modified). Therefore the required PNG assets’ presence in the public folder is not evidenced.",

      "requirement": "On the new final page, include a simple responsive gallery (or equivalent) that displays the newly uploaded PNG images using /assets/uploads/<filename> paths, responsive on mobile/desktop, with at least one interaction path (e.g., click to enlarge) working.",
      "reason": "The new final page references only 4 images (1771025145088.png, 1771025927131.png, 1771025946100.png, 1771025953219.png) and does not include the rest of the required uploaded PNGs (e.g., -1/-2 variants). So it does not display the newly uploaded PNG images set as specified.",
