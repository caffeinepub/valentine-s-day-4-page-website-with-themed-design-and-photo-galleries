## Summary
**Goal:** Build a 4-page Valentine’s Day themed website with consistent romantic styling, simple navigation, and photo galleries using the user’s uploaded images and specified page text.

**Planned changes:**
- Create 4 distinct pages/routes with a shared layout and consistent Valentine’s theme (palette, typography, spacing).
- Page 1 (Landing): Render the user’s long message exactly and display IMG_20260123_022920_162.jpg and IMG_20260123_022853_008.jpg.
- Page 2 (Memories): Show the exact heading “some of the countless memories that we had in the last 8 months” and a responsive gallery with IMG_20260110_001106_333.jpg, IMG_20260123_022956_194.jpg, IMG_20260123_022822_917.jpg, IMG_20260123_023006_342.jpg.
- Page 3 (Gift): Display the exact text “ I will always have all the gift that u gave Mee in my heart ” and show a generated bouquet/flowers image as the main visual.
- Page 4 (Gallery): Show a responsive gallery with the remaining photos: IMG_20260123_022914_736.jpg, IMG_20260123_022814_325.jpg, IMG_20260123_022756_879.jpg, IMG_20260118_135409_239.jpg, IMG_20260123_022932_300.jpg.
- Add visible navigation between pages (top nav and/or next/previous) with an indicator of the current page.
- Add all uploaded images as frontend static assets and reference them by filename (no backend image serving).
- Add required generated theme assets as frontend static assets (background pattern, flower image for Page 3, and heart favicon) and apply them site-wide where appropriate.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a romantic, Valentine’s-themed 4-page site, read the exact messages, and browse the photo galleries with simple next/previous (and/or top) navigation across mobile and desktop.
